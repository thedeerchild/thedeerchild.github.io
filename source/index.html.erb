        <h3>Eric Morris</h3>
        <p>'Ello!</p>
        <p>I'm Eric, a software engineer on Google Maps. I work on hilariously large data pipelines, mostly with an eye towards improving our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistical localization</a> algorithms.</p>
        <p>Before that, I was a tech lead / manager on the Global Growth (International) team at <a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udacity</a>. I got to wear a number of hats there, such as helping grow the team from 6 to 27 full-time engineers, writing (or helping more junior engineers write) most of the core website and marketing infrastructure and generally keeping our A/B tests testing and our messaging integrations messaging.</p>
        <p>Prior to Udacity, I was a Product Engineer at <a href="https://zurb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZURB</a>, where I helped maintain open source projects and Rails SaaS apps, in addition to helping out with frontend development for clients such as Samsung, JCPenny and SAP. I also interned at <a href="https://palantir.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palantir</a>, where I was a Forward-Deployed Engineer on the Healthcare team.</p>
        <p>During my time at Cornell, I served as the Creative Director for <a href="https://cusd.cornell.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cornell University Sustainable Design (CUSD)</a>, a 150+ student organization that specializes in sustainable architecture. I also helped manage a student co-working space called POPSHOP and founded <a href="https://yorango.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yorango</a>, a real-estate startup that focuses on student rentals and subleases.</p>
